################ How browser reads JS #############

1. <script src="./index.js"></script> INSIDE    <head> tag
at this moment browser will start reading this JS file , and will not get any reference for the html ele used in it
bcz those are below of it and Browser has not read those yet . Hence Error will come.

2. <script src="./index.js"></script>  INSIDE    <body> tag but in the end of it
In this first Browser will parse HTML to execute 
Now At the end it will se , It has to load the JS file and execute it .

3. <script src="./index.js"  async></script> INSIDE    <head> tag
In this HTML parsing and JS LOADING both works simultaneously but whenever LOADING  completes It's start executing even if HTML is not fully parsed.
Hence chances of error occuring is high 

4. <script src="./index.js"  defer></script> INSIDE    <head> tag
In this HTML parsing and JS LOADING both works simultaneously , even if JS LOADING is done before HTML parsing , browser will not execute JS.
It will wait for HTML to be fully parsed and then start executing the JS file.
Hence this is more efficient method for linking js file.

Browser creates document object of HTML tree and add this object with window object
